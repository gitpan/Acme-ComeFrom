goto-in-reverse.

* Introduction

INTERCAL programmers have been for a long time monopolized the enormously
powerful construct "COME FROM", both as a flow-control replacement to
"goto", as well as an obvious way to mark parallel execution branches.

But now, with *Acme::ComeFrom*, perl hackers finally could match them on
the front of wackiness, if not of obfuscation.

Please refer to the POD text for synopsis and details on usage.
