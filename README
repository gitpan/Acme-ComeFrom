This is the README file for Acme::ComeFrom, a source filter providing
the "comefrom" construct, an INTERCAL-like parallel goto-in-reverse.

* Installation

Acme::ComeFrom uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL

make install

* Introduction

INTERCAL programmers have for a long time monopolized the enormously
powerful construct "COME FROM", both as a flow-control replacement to
"goto", and as a simple way to mark parallel execution branches in the
multi-thread variant.

But now, with Acme::ComeFrom, we perl hackers could finally be on par
with them in terms of wackiness, if not in obfuscation.

Please refer to the POD text for synopsis and details on usage.
